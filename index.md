Hi, my name is Fred and I have worked in the Alps for over 10 years. I have a wide variety of experience including on piste performance, race coaching and backcountry skiing. I enjoy working with skiers of all abilities but especially with beginners.

The most rewarding challenge for me is the 'Plateau' skier who has reached a point they cannot get past. I have a passion for the mountains all year round and in the summer can be found rock climbing on the crags of North Wales.
